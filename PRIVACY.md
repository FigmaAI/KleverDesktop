# Privacy Policy for Klever Desktop

**Last Updated: December 29, 2025**

## Introduction

Klever Desktop ("we", "our", or "the app") is an open-source desktop application developed by JooHyung Park. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Collect

Klever Desktop is designed with privacy in mind. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers.**

The app operates entirely locally on your device and only accesses:

1. **Local File System**
   - Configuration files stored locally on your device
   - Task files and automation scripts you create
   - Application logs stored locally for debugging purposes

2. **System Resources**
   - Python runtime bundled with the application
   - Local browser automation tools (Playwright)
   - Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for device automation
   - Network connections initiated by your automation tasks

### Analytics

Klever Desktop uses **[Aptabase](https://aptabase.com)** for privacy-friendly, anonymous analytics to help us understand how the app is used and improve the user experience.

**What Aptabase collects**:
- ✅ Anonymized usage events (e.g., feature usage, app launches)
- ✅ Basic session information (without unique identifiers)

**What Aptabase does NOT collect**:
- ❌ Device identifiers, cookies, or fingerprinting
- ❌ Personal information that can identify you
- ❌ Data that can be linked back to individual users

Aptabase is **GDPR, CCPA, and PECR compliant**. All data is anonymized and cannot be traced back to you. For more information, see [Aptabase Privacy Policy](https://aptabase.com/legal/privacy).

### What We Don't Collect

- ❌ Personal identification information
- ❌ Crash reports sent to external servers
- ❌ Login credentials or authentication tokens
- ❌ Any data uploaded to our servers (we don't have any servers)

## Data Storage

All data generated by Klever Desktop is stored **locally on your device**:

- Configuration files
- Task definitions and automation scripts
- Application preferences
- Log files

You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time by uninstalling the application or manually removing the application data folder.

## Third-Party Services

Klever Desktop integrates with the following third-party tools, which run locally on your device:

1. **Python Runtime**: Bundled with the application for executing automation scripts
2. **Playwright**: For browser automation (runs locally)
3. **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)**: For Android device automation (runs locally)
4. **Ollama** (optional): For AI features, if you choose to install and configure it separately

When you use AI features with Ollama or other services:
- You choose which AI service to connect to
- Data is sent directly from your device to the AI service you configure
- We do not intercept, store, or have access to this communication

Please refer to the privacy policies of these third-party services if you choose to use them:
- [Aptabase Privacy Policy](https://aptabase.com/legal/privacy) - Anonymous analytics
- [Ollama Privacy Policy](https://ollama.com/privacy)

## External Network Requests

Klever Desktop may make network requests in the following scenarios:

1. **Automation Tasks**: When you create automation tasks that interact with websites or web services, those requests are initiated by your tasks, not by us.
2. **AI Services**: If you configure the app to use external AI services (like Ollama), requests are sent directly to those services based on your configuration.

All network requests are initiated **by you** through your automation tasks and configurations.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Your operating system's file permissions protect your data
- You are responsible for securing your device
- We recommend encrypting sensitive automation scripts or credentials you may store


## Open Source

Klever Desktop is open-source software licensed under the MIT License. You can review our source code at:

**GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/FigmaAI/KleverDesktop](https://github.com/FigmaAI/KleverDesktop)

## Your Rights

You can:
- Delete all application data by uninstalling the app
- Manually access and modify application files stored on your device
