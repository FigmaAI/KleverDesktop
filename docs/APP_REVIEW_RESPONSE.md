# App Review Response - KleverDesktop

Thank you for your feedback. We have addressed both issues mentioned in the review rejection.

---

## Issue 1: Guideline 5.0 - Legal (China Compliance)
**Issue:** App metadata references "ChatGPT" and "OpenAI"

**Resolution:**
- Removed all references to specific AI service providers (OpenAI, ChatGPT, Azure, etc.)
- UI now uses generic terms: "AI Model Configuration" instead of provider names
- Implemented OpenRouter as a unified API gateway (no provider branding shown)
- Users can configure any OpenAI-compatible endpoint without seeing provider names

---

## Issue 2: Guideline 2.4.5(iv) - Performance (Browser Dependency)
**Issue:** App requires downloading Google Chrome

**Resolution:**
- Added native **Safari support** (pre-installed on all macOS systems)
- Safari is now the default browser - no external downloads required
- Chrome and Edge are optional alternatives with auto-detection
- New "Browser Configuration" menu allows users to select their preferred browser

---

## Testing Summary

✅ **Safari works out-of-the-box** - No external downloads needed  
✅ **No AI provider names** - All references removed from UI and metadata  
✅ **Tested on fresh macOS** - App functions correctly without any additional installations  

The app is now compliant with App Store guidelines and ready for distribution in all regions, including China.
